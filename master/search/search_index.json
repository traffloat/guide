Appearance Corridors are cylinders that connect the centers of the two endpoint buildings. In the Normal Perspective, coordiros are rendered with the color of gases in the corridor. In the Electricity Grid Perspective, each electricity grid gets assigned a color. Each active power cable is rendered with the color of its grid. Transportation Corridors allow electricity, liquids, gases, vehicles and inhabitants to move across the endpoints. When a new corridor is constructed, gases can diffuse through, and inhabitants can move across it freely. Cables, pipes and rails can be added by drawing circles on the cross-section view of the corridor. Electricity Cables can be added to corridors to connect the electricity grids of its two endpoints. The cable can be manually disconnected to split power grids. Transferring electricity through cables consumes electricity. Therefore, it may be useful to turn off electricity cables that are not necessary. Gas Gases diffuse through the corridor. Fans can be installed on terminals to adjust the flow rate of gases. The empty cross-section area of the corridor also affects the rate of gas diffusion. There is no restriction in the variety and pressure of gases. Liquids Pipes can be constructed in corridors. Each pipe can only transfer one type of liquid in one direction. The throughput is computed based on the terminal pumps and the viscosity of the liquid type being transferred.
